5,Arithmetic,"<p>The Arithmetic mentality is that of prehistory and ancient civilizations; it is a generative mentality concerned with the problem of how one becomes many, that is, how the Great Mother gives birth to her offspring and generates difference and time in the form of the male. The architecture for this mentality is the human body, and the ancient statues of the Great Mother are an iconic expression of this worldview. One feature of the Arithmetic Mentality is a fascination with lists and enumeration. The list is magical and numinous, and it becomes a characteristic mentality in the Riverine cultural ecology.</p>

6,Geometric,"<p>The Geometric mentality is the mentality of classical civilizations, and its architecture is architecture itself. The archetypal representation of this mentality is the temple. The Geometric mentality is a world in which the ideal is transcendent; the mental geometrization of the worldview replaces the concrete and sensuous. The idealized mental form and the spirit begin to take over from the concrete and the flesh.</p>

7,Algebraic,"<p>The Algebraic mentality is the mentality of medieval civilizations; its architecture is a celestial code, that is, a transition from the concrete object to an abstract, empowering entity registered in a numinous script. This mentality is also expressed in calligraphy, both Celtic and Arabic, and is a form of expression in which a visionary script is seen to be an angelic epiphany of neoplatonic &ldquo;celestial intelligences.&rdquo;</p>

8,Dynamical,"<p>The Dynamical Mentality emerges in the early 1400s with the Ming Dynasty&rsquo;s advanced naval technology and Xeng He&rsquo;s voyages. The Dynamical Mentality has as its architecture bodies in motion, whether they be planets, oceanic voyages, cannonballs, or systems of currency. Movement is represented by the parabolic trajectory. It is intensified by trade, interest, and a general fascination with motion that culminates with the discoveries and work of Galileo, Newton, and Leibniz.</p>

9,Complex Dynamical,"<p>The Chaotic&nbsp;or Complex Dynamical Mentality emerges in Europe (in Paris, with Poincar&eacute;) in 1887 and becomes a conscious cultural endeavor in places like the Santa Fe Institute in New Mexico. The icon of a fractal image represents the archetype of self-consciousness. The architecture for this mentality is a system of systems, an emergent metasystem that is concerned with the architecture of all possible architectures, real or virtual. One result that we can anticipate with the emergence of this new mentality is an etherealization of architecture, the emergence of a new technology in which structures will be, like a light bulb, &ldquo;turned on and off&rdquo; in manifestation.</p>
