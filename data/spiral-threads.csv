1,Art and Architecture,"<p>The Art and Architecture thread at Ross includes Visual and Performing Arts, Architecture, and Design. Art is examined in its original social and cultural contexts to stimulate discovery and to experience deeper aesthetic, intellectual, and emotional meanings in art. Beginning with prehistory, the focus is on the study of the transformation of artistic expression as well as the functions of art&mdash;didactic, civic, religious, magical, aesthetic, contemplative, critical, personal, and public. The thread examines issues of public and private patronage, the role of the artist, and art as carrier of cultural values and desires. Teaching through artifacts helps students gain insights into cultures and contributes to their understanding of the evolution of human consciousness. The arts provide inspiration for the personal expression of self as well as for endeavors to understand and communicate understanding of the world. This thread includes such topics as sculpture, painting, ceramics, music, dance, theater, monuments, shelter, and graphic design.</p>

2,Brain and Mind,"<p>This thread examines topics associated with the fields of philosophy, psychology, and neuroscience as they emerged and have evolved over time. Attention is given to philosophies from around the world, and the role they have played in shaping today&rsquo;s global society from the fusion of ideals from multiple perspectives. Philosophy and neuroscience are examined from the perspective of mutual influence. Ethics are addressed in the context of core values. The thread includes the study of topics such as epistemology, aesthetics, metaphysics, materialism, psychoanalysis, perception, cognition, neuroimaging, and neuroanatomy.</p>

3,Communication and Media,"<p>This thread explores the methods and purposes of communication, from early humans, to the present, and into the future. The thread deals with the conveyance of factual information in such forms as early human cave paintings, calendar markings on the Ishango bone, hieroglyphics used for record keeping, the Code of Hammurabi, Gutenberg&rsquo;s printing press democratizing knowledge in the Renaissance, and globally accessible information in the digital age. This thread also examines how humans tell stories, from oral traditions, to Homerian poems, to the first published novel, to the moving image, to digital forms of expression. The manipulation of information in the form of propaganda is also examined in various historical contexts, with examples of the practice including Roman coins, Shakespeare&rsquo;s <em>Macbeth,</em> Louis XIV&rsquo;s court of Versailles, and the anti-Communist movement in the United States. The thread includes the study of topics such as mass communication, advent of the radio, the use of posters and leaflets, and Internet videos.</p>

4,Cosmology,"<p>This thread examines the human relationship with the Cosmos from a cultural perspective, beginning with the earliest observations of the night sky for timekeeping, and culminating with the modern understanding of our place in the universe. The study of &ldquo;pre-scientific&rdquo; cosmological myths introduces eternal questions about the scope and scale of the universe, while examining early practices of archaeoastronomy illustrates many ideas that led to the emergence of modern scientific and mathematical approaches to understanding the physical aspects of the universe. With the beginning of the modern era, the various shifts in the human conception of the Cosmos emerge, from the 17th century move away from geocentrism, to the 20th century idea of the Big Bang theory, to the &quot;runaway&quot; expansion described by 21st century cosmologists and more recent discussions about the fate of the universe. This thread includes the study of such topics as astronomy, archaeoastronomy, creation stories and mythology, the emergence of the heliocentric perspective, the Big Bang theory, the fate of the universe, astrobiology, and the field of particle physics.</p>
",,,
5,Geography,"<p>This thread encompasses geology, geography, and the relationship of humans to Earth systems. The thread emphasizes the recognition and importance of the relationships and interconnected nature of place and people at a basic level, including the link between the natural resources of a place and how the use of those resources has implications for other parts of the system. The geography of the planet, including Earth&rsquo;s formation and evolution, and the geographic territory of the societies and empires are studied throughout the Spiral Curriculum. From early agricultural settlements and riverine civilizations, to transcontinental empires, and back to the smallest indigenous villages, the understanding is that culture is shaped by the natural environment by which it is surrounded. Further studies examine how humans attempt to shape their environment to meet personal and societal needs. This thread includes topics such as cartography, demographics, geology, natural resources, geography, and geopolitics.</p>
",,,
6,Migration,"<p>This thread studies the movements of humans, information, disease, genetics, and culture through migration networks and patterns of settlement. The thread begins with the study of animal migration during the early stages of Earth&rsquo;s evolution, and then focuses on the movement of early humans, as influenced by the availability of resources and/or environmental changes. This includes the co-migration of humans and animals as they followed seasonal patterns of change. As settlements disperse and peoples move more from place to place, gene flow becomes an essential element to this thread as one explanation of the diversity and relatedness of humans in a global society. Disease is studied in terms of its spread as a vector force that shapes civilizations, and hence gives rise to the spread of culture and information. Migration is also examined through the lens of population dynamics and how information is shared among groups of people, as well as how culture is transferred and transformed. This thread encompasses topics such as evolutionary biology, cultural transformations due to human movement, the spread of disease, and the transfer of information among groups of peoples.</p>
",,,
7,Power and Influence,"<p>This thread explores the concepts of power and influence as they relate to the ideas of leadership, governance, and movements and their impact on society at large. These concepts are examined at various levels, including personal, community, state, national, and global. The thread also addresses human interactions associated with governance and the organized control of a given population. Throughout human existence, individuals and groups have gained power or influenced others through social, economic, religious, ideological, and political systems to promote a desired result, including the creation of laws and constitutions, negotiation with other power structures, the use of force, and the development of complex military or political systems. These systems are recognizable in numerous forms of human organization, from tribal clans, to monarchies, to oligarchies, to modern nation-states. Leaders of movements are studied as individuals who have risen to an influential status. Democracies and tyrannies are examined throughout history and in the modern world as examples of the influence of power. This thread includes the study of such topics as political movements, forms of governance, law, military, revolutions, and regime change, both peaceful and otherwise.</p>
",,,
8,Societal Organization,"<p>This thread explores the roles humans occupy in society and their interactions with each other. The thread also examines how humans&rsquo; perceptions of the world are shaped by the roles they play. Throughout, consideration is given to the way such roles have or have not evolved over time. At the individual level, these roles are influenced by gender, family and kinship, racial and ethnic constructions, and social and economic class. At the community level, the roles of each person combine and play off each other to weave the fabric of a society, which can also be described by social hierarchies and customs; changes in birth, marriage, and death rates; life expectancy and family patterns; and demographics related to population size and density.</p>
",,,
9,Spirituality and Sacred Beliefs,"<p>This thread examines the role of sacred and spiritual beliefs in shaping personal and cultural transformations, as well as the influences of those beliefs on the evolution of consciousness. The study of sacredness extends from Paleolithic animism and shamanism through the forms of art and ritual, to goddess-worshipping cultures, to the mythology and state-sanctioned religions of early civilizations. The emergence of universalizing religions highlights the impact of moral codes on individual behavior and on society at large. The centrality of faith and the critical role of universal religions in medieval civilizations are examined through the study of wars between believers over land, goods, and ideologies, as well as conflicts among dissenting religious factions. This thread also addresses secular ideas and modern-day anti-colonial movements that have challenged global consolidation. Topics in the thread include individual and human rights, religious extremism, global sectarian conflict, noetic polities, and an emerging biospheric consciousness.</p>

}"">For most of the history of life on Earth, life-forms were embedded in natural systems, and they adapted or perished within them as natural history unfolded over billions of years. In the fraction of time that Homo sapiens have lived on the planet, the development of human consciousness and culture has accounted for dramatic manipulation of those natural systems, creating imbalances and fragilities as human cultural history and natural history intersected.</p>

11,Systems Thinking,"<p>This thread stresses the importance of networks, systems, connectivity, and feedback. Whether exploring the natural world or human cultures, recognition of these systems instills a deeper understanding of complexity and an appreciation and understanding of the need to go beyond reductive cause-and-effect explanations. In early grades, the focus is on identification of networks and elements of systems; in later grades, emphasis is placed on appreciating the difference between linear and nonlinear relationships and exploring the complex dynamics of chaotic systems firsthand. Also important are the modeling of systems and data visualization as key to making sense of large quantities of data and complex interactions. This thread includes topics such as data visualization, complex dynamical systems, networks, feedback loops, and modeling.</p>

12,Technology and Innovation,"<p>This thread explores the impact of the abrupt and often nonlinear progressions of technological innovation on the evolution of human consciousness. From the wheel to the stirrup, the sail to the telegraph, and the invention of zero to the digital chip, technological innovations and the systemic and unintended effect of their introduction often serve as demarcations along the path of humankind&rsquo;s development. This thread includes topics related to advancements in the fields of medicine and mathematics that have led to new discoveries with far-reaching impact in multiple areas.&nbsp;</p>
",,,
13,Trade and Commerce,"<p>Humans have exchanged goods and services since the dawn of civilization; the earliest traces of writing were little more than attempts to record the transaction of goods in the marketplace. This thread follows commerce through history in its most rudimentary formulation, the exchange of goods and services for cash and kind. One component of this thread, &ldquo;Trade,&rdquo; incorporates sociological and economic studies of encounters and exchanges, which range from biological and material products to intellectual products&mdash;including diseases, food items, beasts of burden, innovative ideas, and even human beings. Another component, &ldquo;Political Economy,&rdquo; encompasses various theories or culturally constructed &ldquo;laws&rdquo; of production and exchange, and their interaction with, or emergence through, different political systems and forms of government. A third component, &ldquo;Economics,&rdquo; involves the study of production and exchange, with an emphasis on the quantitative and qualitative contours of exchange systems within a normative &ldquo;capitalist&rdquo; market economy over their political and ideological roots. This thread focuses on topics such as early bartering systems, marketplace transactions, banking, global marketplaces, and the study of present-day economics and the laws associated with this system.</p>
