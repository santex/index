1,1,Kindergarten,"Creation, Elemental Force, and Symbols","<p>Kindergarten at Ross School is a time of origin, of new beginnings. Science, myth, rituals, art, tools, and understanding are completely integrated in a course of study that includes creation stories from around the world; elemental forces; opposites of light and dark, high and low, visible and invisible; the wonder of symbols, letters, numbers, and naming; and the Sun, Moon, and stars. Kindergarten students engage in and learn about the world around them through song, dance, drawing and painting, storytelling, thematic play, nature walks, and hands-on learning. They practice social skills and experience joy and enchantment as they explore the everyday world with one another.</p>

2,2,Grade 1,Patterns and Cycles,"<p>Students in first grade discover predictable patterns in the world and explore them through nature study, rhyme, music, art, movement, and mathematics. From tree rings, to animal markings, to the flow of water, students appreciate that patterning is a way of organizing the world around them. Patterns are understood through all the senses as students actively engage with nature and interact socially. Through cultural studies, students become aware of ritualistic patterns that characterize a culture&rsquo;s celebrations and values, animated by dance and song. Students discover that patterns are dynamic and appear in many forms. Students also learn that patterns sometimes organize themselves into cycles (for example, calendars, the water cycle, butterfly life cycles) and begin to recognize various phases and the transformative wonder of an individual element. Students discover that tools and instruments are extensions of their bodies and minds that help them create, describe, and share their world.</p>

3,3,Grade 2,Systems,"<p>The evolution from creation, to creatures, to the self, active in the world, unfolds as students in second grade connect origins and elemental forces to patterns and then to systems. Students feel a strong sense of self and an enhanced sense of adequacy in their world at this age. Whether riding a bicycle around the neighborhood or hitting a baseball with a bat, sports and technology become a presence in their lives. They experience the dyads of study and play, self and instrument, and self and team on a daily basis and explore the dynamics of systems, including the Solar System, Earth systems, weather systems and ecosystems. Students can observe and accept how the class itself becomes an ecosystem of diversity, with one child expressing one gift, another a quite different gift, and so on. Students understand how the classroom system is an example of how groups can stabilize through diversity and how patterns of systemic self-organization can create cultures of cooperation, respect, and mutual development.</p>

4,4,Grade 3,Evolution of Life on Earth,"<p>Third grade students explore the development of human society from hunting and gathering bands to Ice Age settlements such as Dolni Vestonice. Students begin to develop an awareness that the self is situated in a world and that time itself is part of the process of their own empowerment and unfoldment in the world. A strong sense of justice and fair play arises as students articulate Self and Other in a growing sense of a moral order. Students explore the origins of art, symbolic signs, and religion as they developed together with the rise of human bands and Ice Age settlements.</p>

5,5,Grade 4,"Social Systems, Early Settlements, and Agriculture","<p>Fourth graders study the transition from hunter and gatherer societies to agrarian societies through in-depth exploration of early human settlements such as Jericho, &Ccedil;atalh&ouml;y&uuml;k, and Banpo. They follow the movement of peoples from Africa, to Eurasia, to Europe, to the Americas, and Australia. Students examine both the beginnings of cultural diversification as well as the reasons for, and cultural ramifications of, immigration. They analyze architecture as shelter and sacred space, as in G&ouml;bekli Tepe, and continue to explore the art of early peoples they encountered in third grade. Archaeoastronomy is investigated through the study of megalithic structures and their relationship to time, worship, and ritual. With storytelling as history, they learn about clans and neolithic societies, the role of women in early matristic cultures, and the culture and iconography of the goddess. Students in fourth grade study the first food crops, food storage, and the domestication of animals, as well as related plant biology, ecology, and contemporary agricultural practices throughout the world</p>

6,6,Grade 5,The Rise of Riverine Civilizations,"<p>With the gradual evolution from village gardening under the guidance of women  to city-state agriculture with its male-driven oxen, plows, and state-controlled systems of irrigation, there occurred a coevolution from oral traditions and custom-based forms of matristic authority to political systems of power. Within this new system, literate priests and organized warriors restructured society in a formation scholars term &ldquo;civilization.&rdquo; This transformation of culture involved a shift from shamanism to organized religion. It also involved a shift from the generative values of procreation and numeration, embodied in the icon of the Great Goddess and the prehistoric Arithmetic mentality, to a more abstract Geometric mentality. The latter became embodied in writing, temple architecture, and astronomy, all three of which were articulated in the new system of male power and written laws controlled by high priests and military leaders.</p>

7,7,Grade 6,Prophecy and Cultural Transformation,"<p>The rise of monumental architecture, temple-monopolized systems of writing, and standing armies led to a rigid and crystallized state of permanent war, but the appearance of new and more portable systems of writing spread by a new merchant and trading class enabled individuals to adopt cross-cultural values, share ideas, and question the validity of the values of the warrior and the high priest. This articulation of a new ideal beyond the real conditions of political society interacted with the globally spreading Geometric mentality as individual teachers energized a shift from ancient religions to classical philosophies and mathematics.</p>

8,8,Grade 7,World Empires and Universal Religions,"<p>An empire expands in an effort to extend its political boundaries to become congruent with the peripheral boundaries of the natural resources that support the central ruling society. As trade and commerce help to circulate these resources, a new commercial class interacts with the military class to stabilize these systems of distribution. To legitimize the validity of the imperial power, a new institution, the Imperial School, is founded to rationalize physical force by a transcultural moral order. In the transformation of the charisma of an individual prophet to the routine of a school or a society, new universal religions arise in which the members are not restricted to the tribal identity of the founding prophet.</p>

9,9,Grade 8,The Climax of Hierarchical Civilizations,"<p>Medieval civilizations were hierarchical societies that derived their identity from religious faith but based their social structures on land tenure, warrior status, and display. As competition and conflict arose among religious civilizations, new ideas were disseminated across boundaries, and new religious orders and mystical movements emerged that sought to relate the individual in an unmediated way to the source of the sacred. This shift from the temple-formed Geometric mentality to the individually experienced Algebraic mentality is expressed in new forms of literature that reveal an emphasis on the vision quest and the expression of personal and divine romantic love. It is also expressed in new forms of calligraphy, manuscript illumination, and mathematical understanding that demonstrate a shift from the concrete object or worldly state to a spiritual vision. This transcendental ideal is expressed in the celestial notation of the empowering script of alchemy and algebra.</p>

10,10,Grade 9,The Emergence of the Modern Perspective,"<p>The archetypal idea for the ninth grade is movement, with a focus on the emergence of the Dynamical mathematical mentality articulating a new narrative for the nature of things, in which motion generates value. The motion of money through time produces interest; the motion of sailing vessels produces a new world; the motion of cannonballs destroys feudal fortifications and produces new strategic power; the motion of blood in circulation from the heart (and not the liver) sustains the life of the body; the motion of the heavenly bodies produces new scientific laws; and the motion of individuals out of their class produces a new identity of self in the formative picaresque story of a movement from rags  to riches. All of these epiphanies of movement constitute the cultural shift from medievalism to modernism, with the emergence of the new mathematics of motion in calculus and the mapping of a new world space in a global economy.</p>

11,11,Grade 10,Revolution and the Rise of the Individual,"<p>The focus of the tenth grade is an intense sense of contemporaneity that impels the idea of revolution from the English &ldquo;Glorious Revolution&rdquo; to the Enlightenment; the Industrial Revolution; the American, French, Haitian, and South American Revolutions; and the European Revolutions of 1848. The expansion of European civilization into the New World brings with it a new expansion and empowerment of the middle class. With the democratization of information through printing, the priest and the knight no longer hold between them the traditional structure of civilization. Instead, the scientist, the inventor, and the artist become new charismatic embodiments of a time of change. The dissenting ministers with their congregations, the scientists and inventors with their learned societies, the revolutionaries with their pamphlets and printing presses, and the artists as charismatic geniuses with their own followings all create a new cultural myth of individuality that transforms the millennia-old formations of domination and governance. These political movements are energized by the new sciences in which &ldquo;explosion&rdquo; in chemistry and the questioning of time in the context of Earth&rsquo;s history in geology produce new visions of the possibilities for change.</p>

12,12,Grade 11,Global Economic Consolidation and Visionary Revolts,"<p>Archetypal ideas for this year are speed and transformation: the wedding of time to space in the acceleration of culture through modernization by new cultural vehicles of the world-city and the world war. In both of these large-scale organizations of culture, the new transportation vehicles of railroad, automobile, truck, tank, airplane, jet, and rocket have enormous impact on traditional cultures and religious worldviews. Modernization produces visionary movements that affirm the validity of consciousness and non-rational experience. This conflict between the Mechanists and the Mystics in the articulation of values for a new world civilization continues to this day. Characterized by the shift from Galilean dynamics, with their linear systems of causation and reductionist emphasis, to complex dynamical systems, this period is exemplified by jazz fusion, Cubism, Poincar&eacute;&rsquo;s work on the three-body problem, Einstein&rsquo;s work on relativity, Schoenberg&rsquo;s 12-tone atonality, and continued probing of the unconscious psyche with Freud&rsquo;s psychoanalytic technique. Transnational phenomena such as the Great Depression, world wars, and new political alliances illustrate an increasingly interconnected world. The precedents of the post&ndash;World War II International Military Tribunals and the United Nations&rsquo; adoption of the Convention on Genocide and its Universal Declaration of Human Rights represent the triumph of internationalism over isolationism and the further development of global consciousness.</p>
