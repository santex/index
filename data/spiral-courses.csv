35,0,Cultural History Kindergarten,"Creation, Elemental Force, and Symbols","<p>This course introduces students to the classroom and the beginnings of the academic rigors of school. After an introduction to the functions and meanings of various signs and symbols as abstract systems that help humans make sense of the world, students explore the fundamental concepts of origins and change over time. The idea of change leads to an exploration of the changing seasons and their impact on the environment as well as students&rsquo; reflection on their own experience of those changes. After broadening students&rsquo; perspective to embrace the environment, the course focuses on a sensory-based exploration of the forces of earth, fire, air, and water in their own environment, which promotes a holistic way of viewing the world as well as understanding of the balance of the elements in the natural world and their own place in this complex, dynamic system. By beginning to grasp these concepts&mdash;symbols as tokens of meaning and understanding; the recurrence of change; a holistic view of the world and experience; and the place of humans in complex, dynamic systems&mdash;students receive a foundation on which to build future learning.</p>

70,1,English Kindergarten,,"<p>During their kindergarten studies, students are introduced to and build their knowledge of&nbsp;creation stories, elemental forces, seasonal changes and migration, and the concept of naming. At the same time, they&nbsp;further their love of literature and storytelling, while building basic skills&nbsp;through shared daily reading and writing experiences and small, guided reading groups.&nbsp;Students study the concept of beginnings and learn that every living organism has a beginning. As they examine the concept, students experience beginnings in&nbsp;fiction, nonfiction, and poetry and learn to make text-to-self connections.&nbsp;They engage in retelling, dramatizing, and discussing books and explore storytelling through drawing, dictation, and independent writing. Extending their studies of symbols from Cultural History, students investigate the concepts of letters representing sounds and different sounds working together to form words. They listen to the sounds they hear and experiment with phonetic spelling when they write, while increasing their awareness of sound/symbol correspondence.&nbsp;A formal handwriting program engages students in letter formation, while they&nbsp;practice asking questions, following directions, taking turns speaking, listening to classmates,&nbsp;and exploring the everyday world with one another.</p>

Theater is an imagined world that comes to life as students explore and learn about their lives. Progressing from natural play to an artistic discipline, kindergarten students become aware of theatrical storytelling. After developing an awareness of their bodies and movements, students listen to stories and focus on how a storyteller uses body gestures and facial expressions to convey emotion. They use their mind, body, and spirit to give rise to a creativity that expresses personal and cultural beliefs, such as creation myths like the ones studied in Cultural History. Being trained through theater games and exercises, students gain confidence in their ability to express their stories, and their repertoire expands to include choreographed dance&nbsp;productions. In conjunction with Science and Cultural History, students use improvisational skits, dance, and a culminating performance to present their understanding of the elemental forces of the natural world.</p>

They perform fundamental locomotor (running, hopping, skipping, jumping, leading, sliding, and galloping) and nonlocomotor (bending, twisting, turning, rocking, swaying, balancing, stretching, pushing, and pulling) skills. Students explore elementary skills of manipulating simple objects with purposeful movement (throwing, catching, striking, kicking, bouncing, and rolling). Students learn classroom and playground safety rules through signs and symbols as they enter the wellness classroom for the first time. Storytelling through dance is explored as students put movement to music, and students explore the element of air as it applies to respiration and movement. Units include social skills, fitness, movement qualities, and manipulatives, as well as nutritional studies and the basic needs of both plants and animals. Integrating Wellness studies with other domains, students explore patterns of movement and how elemental forces change and alter the environment around us. In addition to the three main integrated units, ample time is provided between units for cultural- and population-specific movement, dance, and skills. Time is available to develop life skills appropriate to a kindergarten student, such as hygiene, disease prevention, developing communication and listening skills, building self esteem, and practicing safe and healthy daily behaviors.</p>

From bacteria to dinosaurs to&nbsp;Homo sapiens, students learn that life has changed and evolved over millions of years and continues to change. They learn that biology and geology are coevolving systems and as the physical Earth transformed so did the organisms living on land and in the seas. They study fossil evidence and the discoveries of many famous naturalists, archaeologists, and anthropologists, such as Charles Darwin, Mary, Meave, and Richard Leakey, and Mary Anning, and end the year exploring early Stone Age dwellings. Through this yearlong investigation of the evolution of human consciousness, students realize that they are empowered to participate in and affect history.

Focusing on the cultures of early humans, students examine how early human migration influenced the development of cultural diversity. As people migrated, cultures became diverse, dependent upon geography, climate, and resources. Through their study of artifacts, students uncover why early peoples found it necessary to move. They compare their findings with reasons for human migration throughout history. Early traditions and beliefs are explored through the study of cave art and ritual.</p>

As competition and conflict arose among religious civilizations, new ideas were disseminated across boundaries, and new religious orders and mystical movements emerged that sought to relate the individual in an unmediated way to the source of the sacred. This shift from the temple-formed Geometric Mentality to the individually experienced Algebraic Mentality is expressed in new forms of literature that reveal an emphasis on the vision quest and personal romantic love. It is also expressed in new forms of calligraphy, manuscript illumination, and mathematical understanding that demonstrate a shift from the concrete object or worldly state to a spiritual vision. This transcendental ideal is expressed in the celestial notation of the empowering script of alchemy and algebra.
