1,Sylvan,"<p>The Sylvan cultural ecology of the primordial environment encompasses the archaic structure of consciousness, represented by the dominant senses of olfaction and hearing. It is in this ecology that prehominid evolution occurred.</p>

2,Savannahan/Lacustrian,"<p>The Savannahan/Lacustrian cultural ecology is associated with the emergence of the hominization of primates, bipedalism, and upright posture. In the landscape in which hominids emerged, global weather changes reduced the forest and thus the cover it provided, exposing hominids in the savanna. The dominant sense was sight. The last stage of development of this cultural ecology is represented by the use of small pebble tools and perhaps the development of some form of call-based communication system. It is in the Savannahan cultural ecology that we see the evolution from <em>Australopithecus</em> to <em>Homo</em> <em>habilis.</em></p>

3,Glacial,"<p>The Glacial cultural ecology is a compressive one when compared to the previous, expansive Svannahan cultural ecology. Human groups were compressed into new adaptations, requiring clothing and shelter for survival. Within this period of glacial compression arose the new developments of fire, engraved tools, ceramics, jewelry, metallurgy, and fully blown human forms of linguistic communication. In the Glacial cultural ecology we see the movement from&nbsp;Homo erectus&nbsp;to archaic&nbsp;Homo sapiens&nbsp;to Neanderthal and modern&nbsp;Homo sapiens.&nbsp;</p>

4,Post-Glacial,"<p>In the Post-Glacial cultural ecology, climate change allowed humans to move from following wild herds, such as aurochs and reindeer, to corralling them and slowly, over time, genetically selecting animals that were more docile and tolerant of human proximity, thus leading to full domestication. Three distinct human cultures began to evolve: traditional foragers, nomadic herders, and permanent agricultural settlements. As populations grew, hunting bands became tribes and then clans; this new level of cultural complexity called for the development of new forms of authority. The priest replaced the shaman as a figure of power. New ceremonial centers, such as G&ouml;belki Tepe, were built, and priests began to develop a star lore to unite people in a common identity precisely at the point that population growth and diverging streams of cultural evolution began to pull them apart. Thus, pre-agricultural ceremonial centers gave way to Neolithic towns, such as&nbsp;&Ccedil;atalh&ouml;y&uuml;k, and large communities.&nbsp;</p>

"
5,Riverine,"<p>The Riverine cultural ecology articulates the growth of Neolithic towns into full-blown cities, with class stratification into priests, warriors, merchants, and traders, as well as organized religion with fixed mythological narratives preserved in writing, ritual, and star lore (archaeoastronomy). Town structures evolved into city-states, sited near a river, with a need for written laws. Settlements were also enhanced by organized irrigational systems made possible by the city-states&#39; location.&nbsp;</p>

"
6,Transcontinental,"<p>In the Transcontinental cultural ecology, the city-state evolved into a central capital, with a periphery that was transformed into an empire to provide needed resources. Nomadic cultures were minimized as herdsmen become mounted cavalry with the domestication of the horse. Metallurgy became critical in the Bronze and Iron Ages, so securing mineral resources in territories and captured slaves for mining required a political evolution from headman or king with a council of elders to full-blown emperor. Metallurgy also enabled the development of portable value, in the form of coins. A trading class of merchants on land and sea began to weave the tapestry of a world economy both in the Mediterranean and via the transcontinental Silk Road. The portability of scrolls (and hence knowledge) also served to transform local cults into universal religions.</p>

"
7,Oceanic,"<p>In the Oceanic cultural ecology, the empire as a polity sought to fix value in a solid like gold and a place like the imperial capital, but the phase-space of a world economy created by the new mobile merchant class could not be fixed so easily, so new forms of banking and finance developed at a higher level of abstraction than coinage. Currencies developed in China, then with the Knights Templar in financing the Crusades, and then with the Medicis and florins from Florence. New forms of motion, expressed in the design of ships by the Vikings and the Ming Dynasty, enabled empires to project their phase-space across vast oceans. The spread of multiple languages of exchange and multiple classes challenged an empire&rsquo;s ability to fix value and control in a single capital or a single advisory group, such as the eunuchs in the Ming Dynasty or the Roman Church. New religions and worldviews arose and this new dynamic of complexification served to break down empires and foster the emergence of nation-states. New natural philosophies, such as science, began to challenge and limit the old forms of authority. This collapse of traditional forms of authority served to empower the individual and individualism, as new forms of art in portraiture and the novel created new narratives of movement from the Old World to the New World, and from rags to riches. The artist appeared to challenge the authority of the priest, and the revolutionary appeared to challenge the authority of the King or Pope. New philosophies of government began to develop as human culture underwent bifurcations leading to such practices as feudalism, bourgeois democracies, and transnational ideologies such as fascism and communism.</p>

8,Biospheric,"<p>The age of reformation and revolution was supported by the growth of printing and the publication of broadsides, tracts, pamphlets, and books. But every complex adaptive system generates an informational overload or crisis in the geometry of behavior of the system. &quot;Things fall apart; the centre cannot hold,&quot; as Yeats said. In the Biospheric cultural ecology, crime and terrorism express an overload of noise that breaks down boundaries, and &quot;out of the blue&quot; a new attractor&nbsp;emerges. This informational crisis emerged after World War II, as jet travel broke down boundaries, and was augmented as electronics (first television, then the Internet) continue to create a new world noetic&nbsp;system. Space travel and satellites make us aware of the planet in a new way, while ecology and the planetary dynamics of continents, oceans, and atmosphere make us aware of a new level of planetary recursive self-organization. What currencies were to the emergence of the modern world, atmospheric and oceanic currencies become for the new world of the global ecology. In this expansion of boundaries, old forms are compressed into organelles within an organism. Religions are compressed into fundamentalist ideologies seeking to resist planetization, just as the Inquisition sought to resist the Renaissance and the Scientific Revolution, but at the same time, new polities&nbsp;of consciousness arise that no longer base identity upon bloodlines, land, or a single language. Yoga, Zen and Tibetan Buddhism, and Sufism are culturally retrieved and take on a new transreligious life under new boundary conditions as they become integrated into Judeo-Christian worldviews. New forms of global music, art, and science begin to express the emergent forms of not a single global civilization but a complex ecology of diversification, a planetary culture comprising different noetic polities.&nbsp;The traditional nation-state begins to suffer a crisis of its boundary conditions as catastrophes like the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster demonstrate that the commercial nation-state is powerless to govern a global ecology. Deep states (organizations, hidden within a visible government, that do the actual ruling) emerge within national governments in the United States, United Kingdom, Russia, and China, seeking to control a cultural system that is completely out of control. In order for humanity to understand this emergent, as well as emergency, state, the young will need to have an understanding of cultural and planetary ecological dynamics, hence the need for new forms of insight and understanding as expressed in the Ross Learning System.</p>
