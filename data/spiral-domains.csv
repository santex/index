1,0,Cultural History,"<p>Cultural history comprises geography, myth, spiritual practice, religion, philosophy, art history, visual and performing arts, literature, architecture, mathematical thought and practice, scientific discovery, technological innovation, law, government, citizenship, economics, and social and familial patterns, and serves as the nucleus of the Ross curriculum. The Ross Lower School program introduces the child to the wonder of our planet, from elemental forces and origin stories to patterns, cycles, and systems in nature and culture. Beginning in the third grade, Cultural History is taught chronologically and is the catalyst for integrating all other domains. Students in each grade study thematic developments in the evolution of consciousness by focusing on a variety of cultures. As students progress through the grades, they revisit cultures in various periods of history, experiencing an ever-expanding spiral upon which they continually construct new knowledge while reflecting upon previous learning. This approach is designed to foster understanding of historical processes and the use of critical thinking skills across cultures and epochs. Such exploration and understanding is a prerequisite for thoughtful and engaged citizenship in an interconnected world.</p>

2,1,World Languages and Literature,"<p>The goal of the World Languages and Literature curriculum is threefold: 1) to develop each student&rsquo;s strengths as a reader, writer, researcher, listener, speaker, and collaborator; 2) to emphasize the ever-evolving beauty of words, both written and spoken; and 3) to demonstrate the centrality of language to the human story examined in the Spiral Curriculum. As students become familiar with the applications of reading and writing processes, they learn how to monitor their own learning and growth. Whether working on an oral presentation, a research report, a literature log, or an essay, students document the steps followed to complete the project. Teachers assess both the final product and the process undertaken in developing understanding. In this way, Ross students not only demonstrate mastery of content, but also gain an understanding of their own processing skills, an essential component of their continued success as lifelong learners. In addition to communication and expression in the English language, the program also trains students to express themselves in two other contemporary languages, Mandarin Chinese and Spanish, while gaining an awareness of other cultures and perspectives. As students progress from novice to intermediate levels of proficiency, their language develops from concrete to more abstract forms of expression. Students then engage in functional language use with activities that are personalized, experiential, and interdisciplinary. Music, visuals, movement, simulation, and gaming permit an intensified experience of language and help to integrate the domain into the broader cultural and historical foci of the Ross curriculum.</p>

10,2,English,"<p>Integrated with Cultural History, the Integrated English curriculum demonstrates the centrality of language to the human story covered in the Spiral Curriculum. As students learn to appreciate the ever-evolving beauty of words, both written and spoken, they develop strengths as readers, writers, researchers, listeners, speakers, and collaborators. &nbsp;All texts read in core Integrated English courses are chosen with the aim of integrating with the Cultural History curriculum for that particular grade. Reading these texts, students analyze literature and how the author creates meaning while also contemplating how culture influences the author and the written or spoken word.</p>

<p>As students become familiar with their own reading and writing processes, they learn to monitor their own growth. Whether working&nbsp;on a research report, a literature log or on an essay, students document the steps followed to complete the project. Teachers assess both the final product and the unique process undertaken in developing understanding. In this way, Ross students not only demonstrate mastery of content and skill, but they also gain an understanding of their own processing skills, an essential component of their continued success as lifelong learners. Self-evaluation, peer feedback and teacher conferencing augment the process-based approach and all play important roles within the classroom.&nbsp;</p>

4,5,Science,"<p>The word &ldquo;science&rdquo; is derived from the Latin scientia, or &ldquo;knowledge.&rdquo; The philosophy of science education at Ross School encourages all students to master the scientific skills and content essential for participation in today&rsquo;s society. Proceeding in tandem with the school&rsquo;s cultural history curriculum, students first look at the scientific practices that exemplify a given culture and historical period, and then engage in lab activities that illustrate the related theories and show their relevance to contemporary scientific issues, including stewardship of Earth and the importance of sustainability. Ross teachers are facilitators, leading students to observe, question, and explore both the natural world and their own learning processes. Each grade is exposed to a variety of science topics and projects throughout the year, drawing from earth and space sciences, life sciences, physical sciences, environmental sciences, and other fields, including the social sciences. Each science topic contains a wide range of possible avenues for investigation and interdisciplinary integration. Students employ research, writing, mathematics, problem-solving, and communication skills along with a wide variety of computer software programs, including Interactive Physics, Starry Night, Logger Pro, and Excel.</p>

3,6,Mathematics,"<p>The mathematics program at Ross School is characterized by curricular integration with cultural history and a technology-oriented instructional approach. By studying mathematics in conjunction with its historical roots, students learn to appreciate not only the beauty of the discipline of mathematics itself, but also its relationship to evolving aesthetics, technological innovations, and societal needs. The central role mathematics has played in shaping world cultural history is emphasized throughout the program. Ross students learn to do mathematics on paper; with scientific, graphing, and historical calculators such as the abacus and Japanese soroban; and on computers equipped with Geometer&rsquo;s Sketchpad, Excel, and other instructional software. This range of tools both expands the educational experience and allows mathematics to be more effectively incorporated into the interdisciplinary project-based model at the heart of Ross pedagogy. Logic, reasoning, and the application of statistics, including data collection, data display, analysis, and decision making, are the fruits of the study of mathematics. As part of the integrated curriculum, these skills can be used to consider the panoply of human experience.</p>

5,7,Media Studies and Technology,"<p>Media is the locus of 21st century culture and society. The central purpose of the Media Studies and Technology domain is to foster in students a critical awareness of how they use media and how it alters human experience, and to instill in them the creative approach necessary for the development of new applications and potentialities. With the speed and reach of today&rsquo;s communications technologies, Ross students are taught that responsible and engaged citizenship depends more than ever on critical thinking about media. Students are introduced to the use of digital tools and coding as they develop the abstract thinking that is required to be creative, critical, and innovative in the field of digital media and technology. The Media Studies and Technology curriculum also emphasizes the application of a broad range of broadcast, visual, print, and digital media for the purposes of students&rsquo; own original expression, communal process, and curricular presentations in other domains. Through the process of producing media, students learn about the relationships among maker, subject, and viewer while employing critical thinking about media, media literacy, the effect of mass media on culture, the role of new media in the modern era, and media in a global age. Projects ranging from application design to human rights activism are structured to stimulate and strengthen the thinking skills and competencies of students in their respective age groups.</p>

7,8,Visual Arts,"<p>The Ross Visual Arts program aspires to provide an environment that allows students&rsquo; creativity to emerge and flourish through the production of art. It aims to deepen students&rsquo; aesthetic understanding and appreciation of individual works of art and to enhance the study of cultural history and related subjects through an awareness of the role of art as an embodiment of human consciousness. Working in a studio setting with professional artists, students gain experience with a number of artistic media and technologies and discover the properties of each. Individuality is prized, and students are encouraged to explore options and to discover their own methods. In classroom discussions, students present their artistic intentions and engage in critiques of their own work and the work of their classmates. As each student connects to his or her creative powers, it is hoped that a stronger sense of self and a clearer sense of purpose emerges. The Visual Arts program encourages students to become lifelong creative thinkers and practitioners.</p>

6,9,Performing Arts,"<p>The overarching goal of the Performing Arts curriculum is to provide students with an understanding and appreciation of music, theatrical performance, and dance while also offering a wide variety of opportunities to create and participate in concerts and original productions. The performing arts are regarded as art forms, cultural artifacts representing peoples from ancient times to the present, languages of personal and public communication, and vehicles for creative expression. The Performing Arts curriculum aims to address each student&rsquo;s role as both a creator/performer and a connoisseur of the arts. Students explore the history of the performing arts and their integration with visual arts, literature, media, and technology. They learn the importance of disciplined practice in choral, instrumental, dance, and theater courses and share the results with local, regional, and sometimes international audiences, according to a regular performing arts calendar.</p>

8,10,Wellness,"<p>The Wellness program fosters skills, attitudes, and strategies that empower students to make intelligent life choices. The Wellness curriculum encompasses Eastern and Western wellness, team and individual sports, the building of locomotive skills, aerobic conditioning, nutrition, and health education. Ross Wellness courses also seek to establish a balance between individual and collective achievement, with an emphasis on shared experience and teamwork. In the Lower School, daily contemplative practices assist the students in being mindful about their bodies and the world around them. This emphasis on self-awareness and emotional intelligence transfers into Upper School Wellness, where students pursue more in-depth study via elective classes and interscholastic athletics.</p>
